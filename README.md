# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition using PCA and Robust PCA. 

Face recognition is a problem domain in computer vision where low-dimensional linear models have received a great deal of attention. However, since faces are not perfectly convex, real face images often violate low-rank model, due to cast shadows and specularities. These errors are large in magnitude, but sparse in the spatial domain. It is reasonable to believe that if we have enough images of the same face, RPCA  will be able to remove these errors.  


The goal of Robust PCA is D = A + E . This goal can be best illustrated with the image below:
